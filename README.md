# My Portfolio

This project is a static portfolio site. To view it locally, you can open the main HTML file directly or serve it with a lightweight local web server.

## Quick start

### Option 1: Open the file directly
1. Locate `index.html` in the project root.
2. Open it in your browser by double-clicking the file or using your browser's **Open File** option.

### Option 2: Serve with a local web server (recommended)
Using a local server avoids browser security restrictions and provides cleaner asset loading.

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. From the project root, run:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and navigate to `index.html` if it is not the default view.

### Stopping the server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the server to stop it.
